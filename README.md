## ♻ Flow of users according to their status:

- When the user registers => his status is "active".
- If a user with active status logs in => we redirect him/her to the application form.
- If the user completes the application form => the status changes to "job ready".
- If the user with job ready status logs in => we redirect to the user's welcome view
- If the user logging in is admin => redirect to admin welcome view

## 🔑 Types of roles and actions:

- User and Administrator.
- The user can register
- The user can create his profile as a candidate
- The user can modify/update the profile.
- The user can demonstrate the level of his knowledge by means of tests.
- The admin can see the list of all registered users.
- The admin can export user data in an excel file.
